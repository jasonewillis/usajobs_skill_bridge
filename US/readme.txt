00:00:00	today I will tell you how to get into data science in 2024 in the most effective and convenient way I've been in data science and in AI for the last 5 years have worked across many top tech companies in Europe and North America I've also co-founded the data science and AI company lunar Tech where we are making data science and AI accessible to everyone people often ask me how they could get into data science if they would learn data science today they often ask me to become become their personal mentor and to guide them and

00:00:33	they are willing to pay significant amount of money for that but I don't want to charge you today and instead I'm going to give you that information for free I'm going to tell you everything that you need to know in order to get into data science in 2024 in this video I'm going to tell you what data science is what are the common applications and how you can use data science in businesses what you can expect as a data scientist from your career and what are the common career path has and entry positions you can use in order to get

00:01:04	into the field of data science and artificial intelligence what kind of salary you can expect and what are the must have skills that you must learn in order to get into data science and at the end I'm also going to provide you ton of resources and uh courses and boot camps you can follow to become a job ready data scientist in 2024 so without further Ado let's get started so data science is all about mixing in data with mathematics statistics machine learning to find out cool things spot Trends and

00:01:36	make predictions think of data science as a full of this it's everything that we need together we then smartly analyze and tell our stories about what happened what's likely to happen next in the business world it's pretty easy to tell who is actually using data science those companies are often ahead of the game making smart moves based on what uh the data tells them where is in the health care using data to better predict patient outcomes or in marketing understanding customer Behavior how to

00:02:06	serve them better how to increase customer satisfaction data science is making a huge difference why does this matter why does this matter well for starters about 85% of companies are hunting for people that have a data science skills they know and understand that data can lead to making a better decisions being more competitive and yes making more money in some Industries this could mean a difference of millions if not billions cutting costs increasing Revenue increasing customer satisfaction knowing what product to launch how to

00:02:42	optimize operations making it more effective or how to uh ensure that the business is profitable can make or break the business this video was sponsored by lunarch at lunarch we are all about making you ready for your dream job in Tech making data signs and AI accessible to everyone whether it's data science artificial intelligence or engineering at lunar Tech Academy we have courses and boot camps to help you become a job ready professional we are here to help also businesses and schools and universities with a topn training

00:04:33	couple of applications of data science in businesses and the power of data science across various Industries adding a bit more detail and introducing an example from the energy sector so data science is this art of turning data into insights and predictions using a mix of Statistics computer science machine learning and definitely a deep domain knowledge it enables decision makers to cut through the no and focus on what data reveals about the future Trends operations efficiencies and More in case

00:05:06	of healthcare uh in this industry data science is revolutionizing the way we approach disease prevention and treatment in the healthcare industry data science is revolutionizing the way we approach the disease prevention the treatment of the patient op uh the when it comes to the healthcare industry data science is used heavily this days so data science is used in Healthcare in order to improve the efficiency and of the operations in the hospitals and also is revolutionizing the way we approach

00:05:38	disease prevention Diagnostics treatment of the patients by analyzing this large amount of patient data including the health records genetic information data scientists are able to identify these different patterns risk factors for diseases long before the symptoms even occur for instance in uh Predictive Analytics models for hard diseases can analyze a patient's lifestyle family history biomarkers to forecast their risk level this proactive approach then allows for earlier intervention such as

00:06:09	lifestyle adjustment or even preventative medication ultimately improving the patient care and reducing the healthare cost in the retail industry personalization targeting marketing uh identifying what are these different customer Behavior what are the customer groups can definitely help help to improve this customer customer experience but also improve the sales and the profits for the retailers so retailers collect data from various sources including online browsing habits purchase history and even social media

00:06:43	activity by applying data science algorithms they can then identify what products the customer is most likely to be interested in and then recommend them for example if you have been searching for running showes online data science helps retailers to show you ads for related products like sportsware or fitness equipment this is not only something that improves the shopping experience for the customers but also increases the sales the marketing efficiency for the retailers in case of Finance in this sector this relies

00:07:13	heavily on the data science for fraud detection investment strategy where they need to go long and short into different um assets so by examining these patterns in the transaction data or maybe the prices of the assets data scientists can pinpoint different anomalies that suggest the fraudulent activity and this can help to protect customers and institutions in case of Finance in this sector uh this relies heavily on data science for fraud detection for investment strategies by investigating these patterns in the transaction data

00:07:48	in the behavior of a customer Bank can identify whether they are dealing with fraudulent activity or not and in this way protecting also the customers and the institution itself sophisticated algorithms can analyze the market trends Financial indicators to advise the investment opportunities and this can help the investors to maximize the Returns on their Investments when it comes to the energy sector data science can be used there to improve the overall uh level of sustainability of the sector

00:08:19	so sustainability in oil production for instance a compelling application of data signs in making of oil companies more sustainable and eco-friendly is the following consider this oil company that can reduce the carbon production by uh oper operations efficiency so by understanding what are the areas that the uh company uh has that um for instance if we are dealing with this oil company and uh the oil company has this different parts of the operations that help you um refine the oils and then uh

00:08:56	generate the final products of course in different stages it produces different amounts of uh carbon dioxide that goes onto the uh environment and if we want to make this company more sustainable more eco-friendly we want to identify the parts of the operations that produces the largest amount of carbon dioxide so it's the uh most dangerous for the environment and then we can see whether by not compromising the existing operations we can still remove certain parts and by how much in those operations to ensure that the overall um

00:09:34	production of this carbon dioxide will be reduced and this way we can then improve the uh overall sustainability and eco-friendliness of this oil company but at the same time the oil company will continue the operations and produce the same amount of uh refined oils for example by deploying sensors across their operations even from drilling sites to like refineries the company can also collect a fast area of data on energy consumption emissions and also the production output then data scientists can use this data to build

00:10:10	models that will exactly identify where this highest carbon emission occur within the operations perhaps it's a particularly Refinery process or maybe certain drilling techniques that are less efficient then this can help the company to implement a targeted strategy to reduce the emission such as optimizing ing operations adopting cleaner techniques or Technologies or enhancing the equipment efficiency this will not only help the company to become more sustainable but it will also align with these Global efforts for combating the

00:10:43	climate change also by reducing this waste and improving this operational efficiency the company can lower the costs demonstrating that sustainability and profitability can go hand in hand at the moment a starking 85% of companies are looking for data scientists but they are unable to find them marketing the demand has shoted data science into the spotlight making it as not just a cool job but a lucrative one too it's also your getaway to get into Fields like Ai and machine Learning Without a solid

00:11:17	grip on data science knowing all these different skills that you need to be a data scientist you cannot really go into Ai and machine Learning Without a PhD but beyond the hype is a field that offers the chance to solve real problems earn a great salary it's fun and exciting and also it helps the businesses in significant ways and also the lives so stick around as we break down what you need to get started in data science if you're curious about how to dive into AI make businesses smarter change the healthare and make a lot of

00:11:52	impact let's now start with the must have skills to get into data science skills from the badrock of your data science Journey Journey will equip you with the tools needed to explore Advanced territories such as artificial intelligence machine learning first you must have this skill in the mathematics and here I'm not just talking about the high school mathematics like basic arithmetic but really about Concepts like bit more complex Concepts like differential calculus differential Theory and also linear algebra so when

00:12:24	it comes to differential Theory this is usually uh from the um so this mathematical concepts are very important for understanding and applying not just basic data science but also machine learning algorithms and they can later help you to get into ML and then artificial intelligence but also the Deep learning Concepts and understanding this all you will need to know and you will have a need to have a solid understanding of linear algebra solid understanding of differential calculus differential Theory and bit of uh

00:12:56	geometry and these different concepts intuition and interpretation so let's start with a high school mathematics in order to get into data science you need to feel comfortable with calculations solving quadratic equations working with polom understand how you can calculate the discriminant find the solutions to equations understanding mathematical notation basic trometry geometry such as Pythagorean theorem the basic concepts like sinus cosinus tangent cotangent then we get into differential Theory so

00:13:28	a good understanding of calculus so differential theory is usually part of calculus one and two and three this will be very important this includes knowing how to find the slope inflation points derivatives gradients concept of integration for data science knowing also multivariate calculus especially up to two variables is necessary you should be able to calculate partial derivatives understand gradients Dehan which plays significant role in machine learning and in deep learning this differential

00:13:58	Theory will be very important when it comes down to more advanced data science Fields like machine learning deep learning understanding these different optimization algoritms HGD GD HGD with momentum or RMS prob for all this you will need to understand this concept of gradients how you can calculate them the partial derivatives and this will help you to later on advaning your career of data science so when it comes to the linear algebra linear algebra is usually part of the Bachelor of econometrics or bit

00:14:29	more Advanced sciences and this is fundamental for data science key Concepts include understanding dot products the concept of vectors vectors operations metric operations like transpose inverse determinant properties of symmetric and diagonal matrices able to solve different equations um and linear systems using gaan elimination gaan reduction understanding the different concepts of DEC composition igon values igon vectors calculation of them the the concept of linear Independence the span no space uh com

00:15:05	space bases uh able to understand this concept of uh gr Schmid uh algorithms so different algorithms that you need to use in order to solve linear systems and also to understand different metric factorization Concepts including the uh I value DEC compositions based on I values and ion vectors the QR uh the composition you need to understand this uh different operations you can apply on matrices how to multiply a matrix with a vector what are the properties this concept of rank concept of Dimensions uh

00:15:39	I do not want to scare you uh that's definitely not uh my goal but I want to make this different than all the other videos that you would see because um the videos saying at higher level you need linear algebra but not providing you those details and those are Concepts that from the first view might seem complex but if you hear the clear explanation it will make much more sense so uh this uh here my goal is not to scare you but to truly provide you this step by step actionable insights and you rather can

00:16:13	be prepared now from what you can expect to become a well-rounded professional rather than to every time understand that there is something missing in your theory of mathematics to truly Master the art of artificial intelligence and machine learning because if you want to go Beyond of using libraries and understand those different concepts knowing linear algebra and these different concepts from linear algebra will be very helpful another field that you must know is the statistics so understanding fundamentals of Statistics

00:16:45	is very important order to get into data science it's essentially the bread and butter of this field without so grasp of Statistics navigating this complex Concept in data science can become significantly challenging here is the breakdown what exactly you need to know in statistics in order to get into data science in 2024 you need to know this concept of variables you need to understand what are this random variables this concept of population and Sample what is this differences why we need the sample when uh we can use

00:17:19	population why we can't use population understanding concepts like probability Theory knowing how to define and work with random variables and their outcomes and also understand this uh different concepts that are crucial for inferences about larger data sets or using smaller data sets for larger uh entire population mastering the rules and the uh fundamentals for probability understanding what are these different probability distribution functions that we uh must know including the normal distribution poison

00:17:52	distribution posterior understanding the foundations of probability Theory knowing how to define and work with this random variables their outcomes the samples and population so to understand the differences between the two and why we will need to use the sample to make conclusions about the larger population when it comes to the probability Theory we need to master the basics of probability uh lows including conditional probability the bias rule which are really important then you also need to understand the descriptive

00:18:25	statistics how to calculate the mean the variance standard deviation why we need them how they can describe data also correlation Co variance what is the difference why we need them how we can use them to identify and describe the data when it comes to probability distribution you need to be familiar with uh normal distribution poison distribution bomal distribution binomial distribution understanding this will help you to uh get ahead and understand more complex Concepts the uh predictions prior probability posterior

00:18:58	probability some regression as is also important what is this linear regression why we need linear regression this concept of statistical significance uh variables independent variables dependent V variables hypothesis testing how hypothesis testing is related to the statistical significance why we use linear regression for causal analysis what is causal analysis uh what is this uh different sorts of test that we can use to test statistical significance what is the T Test what is the F test what is

00:19:30	the non-parametric kcare test this difference between non-parametric and parametric what is this idea of statistical significance the P value type one error type two error um and also this uh different uh errors that we uh have in statistical testing and also you need to know inferential statistics so the law of large numbers the uh Central limit theorem why we need them uh how they uh help us to make conclusions about the population uh by using this um uh sample um in here this is a huge list of Concepts from the

00:20:07	first view but actually uh when you have this good guidance and you have this good resources and you know what exactly you need to learn it will become much more digestible and knowing the mathematics that I mentioned before this will definitely help you to learn the statistics in easier way a good explanation with the corresponding examples will definitely help you to uh better understand this different statistical concept and uh these different concepts they um come all together and later on we will see in

00:20:40	different uh case studies some of which are also in this Channel and uh can help you to understand why those concepts are actually important because whenever you have a data science case study or just in general a study related to data then um the mean the variance and standard deviation those are usually Concepts that are must uh as your first step to learn about your data so case T usually will then start with identifying the problem but then the next step will be to describe data and you will describe

00:21:13	the data with the scripted statistics like the mean the standard deviation variance correlation covariance and this all will help you to explain your data and tell a story about your data so uh this is just an example on how statistic is highly related to this concept of data science and how these different topics that I just mentioned are musts in order to get into data science in 2024 so next up is the concept of machine learning so you definitely need to have a traditional machine learning skill set to get into data science so

00:21:48	you need to understand these fundamentals and this includes the traditional machine learning and not the advanced ones so you can explore the advanced um topics but I would suggest you start with the basic so you must distinguish uh between supervised and unsupervised learning know the classification versus regression uh models how to evaluate this type of models what is this entire cycle of training and testing and validating different machine learning models what is this idea of splitting the data why

00:22:19	we need the training uh data and where exactly uh why we need the validation data the test data and understand this different uh linear regression and classification models definitely know the um traditional and most popular algorithms for linear uh from linear regression to the boosting techniques including linear regression logistic regression the Canon LDA uh also decision treets for classification and for regression understand the begging the boosting random Forest this different boosting algorithms like XG

00:22:53	boost a boost light GBM uh and different resampling Tech techniques including the cross viation different sorts of cross viation like kold cross viation leave one out cross viation then you also need to understand this concept of boot shopping and how you can just in general use machine learning for Predictive Analytics so you also need to understand this concept of um uh Matrix that you can use in order to evaluate different machine learning algorithms both for classification and for regression like uh mean squared

00:23:28	error uh or uh roof me squ error which is for regression problems and uh using for instance the cross entropy or the F1 score recall or Precision for the uh classification type of models so this entire process of learning uh the skill set of um machine learning the traditional machine learning here what I'm talking about is really important for getting into data science and also um being at the top of it so not just the data analy part of data science but really the fancy and fun part which is the Predictive Analytics and that's

00:24:04	something that you can do with the traditional machine learning so when it comes to the Deep learning which is more advanced machine learning I will suggest to lay low for for for the moment and uh in the beginning of your career but once you master the traditional machine learning then you are ready to get into bit more advanced machine learning and then understand the Deep learning concept including the neural networks Etc next next up is the AB testing so AB testing or split testing is very important for your data science skill

00:24:35	set especially in product data science and product development and feature testing so it involves comparing two versions A and B to determine which performs better on given Matrix so uh if you want to in an intelligent way test out different features of your product for instance you want to uh compare one algorithm with the other one or you have a new feature and you are proposing to launch this new feature but you actually want to learn from the customers whether they like it or not then you can compare

00:25:08	this new feature with the existing one using AB testing so in a data driven way without using the guesses or speculations you will ask the customers to tell you whether they like this new feature or not being able to intelligently conduct an AB test is really important and will set you apart as a good data science practitioner as part of the AB testing skill set I would say that designing an AB test understanding the uh Power analysis this uh three different parameters that form the power analysis how you can design

00:25:43	this complete test from the primary metric how to choose primary metric like conversion rate or click through rate and um up to the point of uh estimating or calculating the minimum sample size these are all really important on understanding how to conduct the sorts of analysis you know the calculation of the duration of the test conducting the test knowing how to monitor the test what is this idea of Integrity avoiding the pitfalls that can screw up the results uh how to not do p hacking and then once you get your data and you have

00:26:18	collected the data how to conduct an AB test results analysis in Python calculating the standard error the pulled variance the pulled estimates the pulled variance and then the corresponding uh test statistics standard ER of the test statistics and then calculate a p valum understand how to compare to this uh significance level how to conclude whether you have a statistical significance or not how to conclude then whether you have a practical significance and then next up to uh ensure that you are not running

00:26:51	into one of the AB testing pitfalls is an art on one hand but it's actually um data science concept on the other one so knowing how to conduct this test end to end understand all the technical details behind it the statistics behind it mathematics behind it is really important and can help you a lot in making a datadriven decision and helping the businesses not to um screw up when it comes to making changes in their products and uh in different decisions getting into data science in 2024 means that you know only need to know those

00:27:29	Basics but beat more few important areas like uh NLP or at least introductory level NLP programming especially Python and understanding the business acent here is a simple breakdown so understanding NLP means uh knowing at least the basics like how to process text Data you need to know how to uh do tokenization some basic NLP techniques like um how to use backup words counter vectorizer tfidf uh different sorts of uh semantic uh analysis techniques how to work with embeddings what they represent how they

00:28:10	are related to this uh Infamous language models and know at least higher level what this model represent like the bird gpt3 GPT 4 the GPT series T5 it's actually good to know this when it comes to I would say that as an introductory data scientist you don't don't need to know this uh Concepts uh in detail like Transformers you know multi-ad attention Etc you don't need to know those but at least you need to understand at high level what they uh represent and how they can be utilized for different uh businesses in order to

00:28:46	interact with AI professionals with machine learning engineers and later on once you master data science you can always get into AI so when it comes to the programming programming is really important so in depend what kind of area in data science you go python is the go-to language for data science because it's easier to learn and it has a lot of tools for analyzing data even if you are considering learning R I would suggest that um R is good for people who want to stay with data analytics side of data

00:29:17	science and they just want to do statistical analysis because R is great when it comes to doing visualizations running um different sorts of uh regression models like uh linear regression GMM fgs GLS and um logistic regression do clustering given but when it comes to uh doing machine learning or AI so training machine learning models which are a bit more advanced later on training neural networks then I would say that python will be the go-to option because uh for people who want to get into data science and then later on have

00:29:54	the option to get into machine learning and AI which are more advanced levels um after data science is a field that you mastered I would say python will be a much better decision for you than to go with r because R will be helpful up to the point when you decide that you actually want to learn machine learning and AI so python is uh able to do everything that R can do but it goes beyond the uh data wrangling data processing and a basic statistical analysis it um has many great libraries um including the pie torch and the

00:30:33	tensorflow that will allow you to learn the applications of machine learning deep learning how to train um different large language models how to train different generative AI models like gens vaes so Auto encoders um but also to do basic stuff like uh performing data analytics python has great libraries like the pendis the numpy for data wrangling data analysis data loading data preprocessing and you have to know this when it comes to both python andr if you want to get into data science so python

00:31:10	can do that by utilizing the different libraries that it has then when it comes to going Beyond data preprocessing python has also many other libraries including the uh psychic learn great for machine learning python has the stats models for statistical modeling the math Li um library nltk for NLP the uh Spa uh Spacey uh also uh great library and then uh many other libraries uh for visualizations including the INF famous to which is the uh Med PL Le and the uh Seaburn both uh great uh visualization

00:31:49	techniques that you can use to visualize your data was tank within the interface of python and here when I'm saying python I mean not only knowing all this but also the basic stuff that everyone needs when it comes to programming like basic data structures Understanding Variables arrays matrices uh how to work with these different indices um working with for Loops e statements different conditions while loops and also understand how you can uh go beyond this Basics and um how to perform data analytics in Python how to do Predictive

00:32:25	Analytics in Python by using this different machine learning libraries uh how to train and test and validate um different machine learning algorithms and uh later on you will also learn how to train more complex machine learning algorithms including the Deep learning algorithms in Python another skill that I would say is the communication combined with the business Acumen and uh it would not be fair for the interns or the entry level candidates um from from them businesses to expect from uh these

00:33:00	early professionals to have the enough communication and the business skills to um perform in such way as the senior data scientist would do because when you are entering the field of data science you are usually either just from graduated from your boot camp or you are just graduated from undergrad or your master's degree in data science therefore uh for entry level data scientists I would not say that the communication and business acument is a must having this Theory and the Practical and this hard skills is what

00:33:36	will set you apart as an entry level candidate but having the communicational skills and the business acument will definitely set you apart from the other candidates that have the hard skills but don't have the communication skills and the business acument because at the end of the day in the data science we not so much care about the underlying moral that we use or what kind of statistical or machine learning Technique we use but really we care about the story that the data tells us that the uh data tells us

00:34:07	and help us to improve the business and at the end of the day all we care about is to use that data to improve business or improve operations in the uh institutions or help the customers uh make them happier and uh build some products that the customers will be really happy about so we want to use this different hard skills in order to benefit a stakeholder and the stakeholder can be an institution can be a business can be a a user but we what we want to do is to make use of the data science statistics mathematics

00:34:44	programming in order to uh come up with Solutions and uh come up with products that will help the end user and that's exactly where we need our business Acumen and our curiosity in order to ask questions why and not how that will also differentiate you from other data scientists when you care not only about how so what kind of model to use and how to use it but also the why why we need that model and why we need that solution and what kind of impact would that make and also when it comes to communication

00:35:19	so not just to know how to train this machine learning model but to truly understand why we need that how we can formulate the problem that the stakeholder will understand because sometimes and actually most of the time the stakeholders are people with no Tech background so be able to make those translations to know what is the business problem translate it back to the data science problem and then understand how you can relate them solve the problem in data science the technical one yet translated and

00:35:48	communicated in a non-technical words those all are actually part of this uh optional skill set that I would suggest for entry level candidates but definitely a must when it comes to growing in your data science career because you need to understand how you can communicate and tell your data story which goes beyond those uh technical parts of your data project and also to have a business acument to understand what it means to have a efficiency in the business to understand what are the different parts that most likely are

00:36:26	struggling and the data you research uh and uh using data science can help us to benefit understand and communicate with the business partner such that uh you can come up with a potential solutions for their problems and in many cases the businesses themselves don't even know how the data can help them and that will be your job as a data scientist to identify those different areas that can potentially improve the business and having this business acumen espe especially once you grow in your data

00:36:59	science career can be fundamental in helping you to make your stakeholders happy to Growing your career and to become a real professional in data science so let me give you an example it can be that you're um uh you are a meteor data scientist so you are working as a junior data scientist for two years you are at the level of meteor data scientist and then the business comes and says well here we got all this data we got this business but we don't don't know what we can do with it then as a data scientist you can if you have a

00:37:33	business acument then you will go and do your research and you will understand how you can um identify the different areas in that business what are those different areas in that specific uh industry and for that specific company and you will propose these different solutions and then the company can choose what they think is the most important one for them it can can be that uh you are dealing with a marketing company and that marketing company has a lot of data but they don't know how they can use that data to um improve their

00:38:08	marketing um efficiency you can use their data and um help them to understand the behavior of their customers you can then cluster those customers into different groups you can find out what those customers are likely to do in these different groups and then based on that you can advise them what kind of marketing strategies they can use in order to improve their marketing efforts while um decreasing their marketing costs but for doing this you need to understand what kind of business you are dealing with what kind of data

00:38:43	they got the coverage of the data potential implications the um area that the company is covering um what kind of customers you are dealing with the nature of the data and whether do you know different C uh customer segmentation techniques for instance and what kind of segmentations techniques you can use in order to customize their C uh in order to segment their customers into groups and um how those customers need to be treated in order to improve the marketing efforts which means potentially increase revenue and then

00:39:20	decrease the cost uh which means the marketing um cost that they are spending on these marketing efforts knowing this is really important once you interact with product managers once you interact with uh stakeholders business clients because it will be much easier for you to communicate with people with no Tech ground yet understanding the business really well and then learning from them too which will help to improve your data science project um impact let's now talk about the list of resources that you can

00:39:54	use free and paid in order to become a job already data science professional many people choose the academic path which means that they graduate from bachelor's degree or from master's degree in data science and many people that you see now in data science great professionals with a well-rounded technical skill set and making a lot of impact they don't have a MERS in data science but they do have some sort of technical degree or they have graduated from a strong boot camp now I do know that a boot camp can cost a lot of times

00:40:27	50 till 20K per person which is not very accessible and uh academic path might not be the choice for you so here is the list of free and paid resources to help you become a job ready data science professional so let's rest start with mathematics for learning mathematics you can use resources free resources like Can Academy that has ton of great material when it comes to those uh fundamental concepts from linear alge differential calculus prealgebra in order to master those skill set and become a job ready professional the

00:41:05	thing is with that uh is that uh the curriculum still need to be selected which means that you need to know exactly what to learn and what not to learn to not end up with a case that you learn everything and then spend a lot of time in there that you can actually spend to not learn those um optional skills from mathematics and instead you can spend that time learning other skill set also very important for data science what I would suggest you then to do is to get in touch with us to uh join our

00:41:35	short list uh because we are going to launch our because our mathematics boot camp is about to launch and uh that one is going to cover all the mustow knowledge when it comes to mathematics to become um person that knows all this must know skills from the field of mathematics including linear algebra differential Theory and pre arra now when it comes to the uh fundamentals to statistics uh you can when it comes to fundamentals to statistics here I got both free and paid resources for you so the resource that

00:42:12	you can use for free is the fundamentals to statistics handbook which covers at high level all these mustow Concepts that you need to know this fundamental Theory when it comes to statistics it doesn't contain too many examples or applications but it does contain the theory that you need to get into data science in 2024 when it comes to the more detailed laid down approach uh the course of fundamentals to statistics will be great choice for you it is also uh it also part of our ultimate data science boot

00:42:46	camp so you got a choice here to either go with the course itself to join the fundamental use statistics it covers all the theory and a lot of practical material and quizzes to help you master the fundamentals of statistics and at the same time you can also decide to go for the ultimate data science boot camp which is very similar to uh the uh which which covers not only fundamentals to statistics course but also all the other Concepts that you need to become a Job rated professional so unless you are

00:43:20	someone who alternatively you can also go with the fundamentals if you want more detailed approach such that you learn both the theory as well as the implementation examples and quizzes you can also go with our fundamentals to statistics course which is by the way also part of our ultimate data science boot camp so you have a choice in here you can go for the ultimate data science course or the ultimate data science boot camp and both of them will help you to master the field of fundamental to statistics the next skill set uh and the

00:43:54	resource corresponding to which I will provide to you is the fundamental to machine learning for fundamental to machine learning you can make use for free and you can download this handbook which is the fundamentals to machine learning handbook this handbook covers all the algorithms that I mentioned today the must algorithms uh at a higher level with their corresponding python code you can download this for free in our free resources section at lunch. alternatively if you want to master the machine Lear learning learn

00:44:28	the theory with our demos with our lectures but also combine this with examples and uh quizzes then go for the fundamentals to machine learning course at lunch. this is also part of our ultimate data science boot camp like in case of fundamentals to statistic section when it comes to the AB testing we have a comprehensive AB testing course covering everything in one place at lunch. a so you can follow the fundamental us to a AB testing course at lunch. which is also part of the ultimate data science

00:45:04	bootcamp too when it comes to the NLP you can follow our introduction to NLP course and this is also the part of the ultimate data science boot camp so python for data science is also um course that you can follow at lunch. aai to master all the python topics that you need to get into data science there are also many free courses out there including some introductory level course a crush course at our YouTube channel that you can uh try in order to learn the very basics of python not a comprehensive list just a small portion

00:45:41	but still something to get started if you want to combine all these resources in one place and become a job ready professional in trival 6 months I would highly recommend you to try our ultimate data science boot camp which is the most accessible yet most comprehensive data science boot camp out there this is combined with a corresponding certification which will show that you have completed not just the theory but also the Practical case study projects across different fields in data science as well as interview preparation and

00:46:15	many assignments and quizzes so this ultimate data science boot camp covers the fundamentals to statistics fundamental Su machine learning introduction to NLP complete AB testing Python programming for data science specifically and this is all combined with multiple case studies from different fields including product data science machine learning statistical modeling causal analysis even recommender systems from Ai and NLP we are updating those case studies every month which means we are updating this

00:46:49	list of case studies continuously and the uh ultimate data science boot camp not only contains the fundamental theory in in the most comprehensive and detailed way with many examples quizzes and assignments combined with the Practical projects that you can put on your resume and to Showcase your skill set but it also contains career guidance to Showcase what exactly the road map for data science and machine learning looks like what you can expect from a careering data science what you can expect from an interview process of data

00:47:22	science and what are these different uh type of interviews that you'll need to prepare how you can use our different courses as part of data science boot camp to prepare entirely end to endend for your data science interviews and to master them with confidence and to Ace them with confidence beside this you'll also get ton of resources all these handbooks that I mentioned you can complete the ultimate data science boot camp the most accessible yet comprehensive boot camp providing all inone solution to become a

00:47:56	job rate professional in 3 to 6 months or you can do it on your own face part-time virtually and this can be a weather in 6 months or 12 months depending on what your motivation is depending on what kind of free time you have what uh your work life balance looks like and how much time you want to put into I would say you have a choice of a subscription plan and we have three different options you have the monthly option which you can use for exploring the product the this is 150 now on monthly basis alternatively you have so

00:53:32	with wealth of knowledge here to share with you uh Cornelius uh you are a data science manager at aliens so can you walk us uh through your journey uh in the data science field and how you uh went through the corporate leather oh that's a my story I think so I think I will go back to the beginning for us so before I go to like all the corporate stuff so I starting actually like every student every aspirant scientist I want to become a data scientist but I'm starting not majoring in any data science field I actually

00:54:12	majoring in a biology and aary biology my bachelor my master atic is all about biology I a researcher at heart obiously but there um just like a moment where I become a data scientist that I want to become a data scientist so this is the moment that on the first coming where I was like in my master study I listening at w webinar and I try to see what kind of a job that I could have in the future because like like this like as biologist especially my country in Indonesia it's kind of a little bit hard to actually finding that

00:54:53	securing that I I was say like I really money money having some some money for the job like that's like Financial security job because like it's a little bit harder in Indonesia and even it work I if you do as a biologist here this my paent but then I try to find something that is still related to my biology it's still to related that with my patient like I any research but what could actually make some money and that's where I actually finding some like called data science so this is like what I try to

00:55:27	searching doing my look at this webinar another scientist and then I tried to learning about it okay they used to establish thing they using Mach learing things and then they try to use data actually solving a business problem and then is actually using in business and then day I realized okay this my could be my next current move so at that time my master of time even like I I'm not graduate yet I try to learn as fast as possible regarding data science I try to join this kind of online courses I try to enjoy like a community

00:56:01	in the social media and I try to read it as much as possible and then yeah when I coming back from my master to back to India yeah I focusing on selfing again and then I try to join like uh really offline classes through data scientist yeah and then they try to make a connection as much as possible from all of the my previous connection that I already have like could I become a data scientist in your company basically how like do you feel yeah and then I by a little bit hard work so I can s like

00:56:33	from 2018 to 2019 so like one and year and a half work moving from this field from field and then I become a SST super cool that's quite an impressive journey in such short amount of time you managed to you know to go through all these different levels cuz you know data science can be tough especially in the beginning when you want to get your first job uh as a junior data scientist with almost no experience right and you were went from uh biology not a so-called traditional data science study all the way to the

00:57:11	fields of data science so uh let's talk about that can you talk about some of the challenges that you uh overcame when you are just starting out with no experience at all yeah there like a lot of challenges if like when my first start as a data scientist I don't know anything I I know it's a little bit about programming I know a little bit about statistic I know a little bit here and there but when you're already being in the corporate basically because like my big job right now as a like in the

00:57:45	corporate there's like a lot of things to be learning especially in the business partk yeah you can develop like some model I mean like you can try to run this code but this is is it solving this business problem is it like really valuable to our business is it like really could be convincing enough to be used by the business people and the business team or even like from the customer part to actually they want to using this kind of my model like my study my learning so this is actually something that I learned during the my

00:58:19	uh first year if I like the law if I like the law I still relearning like what is about the business itself because like as a jior scientist we are working at the B we are working usually in the to execute to performing uh what the task is going to be right but in corporate it's a little bit different I think like the start up that mightbe you could try to like you could like do everything as but in corporate it's having a this little bit different because it's a is already being structured organized already in there

00:58:53	and there already um business moving there and the bus is already know what they want the business already know what could make money in there and then the business already know what it what should be data science and new stuff data scientist is could be there to automate stuff could be try to integrate all the new thing in the business but the but as the data s itself if you're like a junior we need to understand why this bu process M so for example like in my years experience as Junior like one

00:59:24	of the first modeling that I create is like this called a propensity to buy model so this is like model this like a modeling that try to predict which customer that will be approached to buy a new insurance basically or a new product it seems easy it's like you just take a data of the customer and then you could try to which one is the one who buy which one who not buy and then you try to create a modeling that's there but the mov part is actually there's a lot of the that there's a lot of puzzle

00:59:54	pieces in there so yeah you have the model but what kind of product that you actually sell who's the target of the customer who's going to execute this list who's where the where's the communication is going to be so and then how long it's going to be the is campaign how long is it going to be is it going to be like a continuous or is it like just a one time there's like a so much moving back in there and then you need to like working a lot with the business so that's one of the part that where I was like in junor that

01:00:26	relearning but that's actually one of the thing that make my career actually boosted up because I really so much about the business and I also learning about the communication within this business part because like like I said before like you want to convince the the customer I say like customer user the part that they you want to use this model you want I I can do my job but can you believe my job so B signal like that it's makes like a really good translation between our technical to the business uh term basically so I canot

01:01:04	present my model as like for examp like a random Forest this is like how this is work and this like this is the Precision this is like recall classification model no they don't right yeah but what they understand is like for example like I create a proper model this kind of modeling when we are simulated basically it could have to your Ki B your Ki is made for example like uh income like increase the revenue in a monthly it could increase the revenue 20% compared to the normal job that you do and

01:01:38	simulation so there there just an example but this like some kind of uh need to be rethinking compared from our technical to how the business actually speaking I always I always call it translation and I think I couldn't say it even better than what you just said it's really important also from my experience and from what I seen in my colleagues being a data scientist is not just you know crunching numbers many people think it's just statistics or maybe some mathematics or really data but it's like you just said all these

01:02:11	different skill set that have to come together like business acument what you just mentioned and uh communication translation from business you know to technical terms because uh usually uh the product managers will never come and tell you please make an classification model for me to classify this thing no they just come and say I need to do this and then you need to realize that oh you need a classification model oh you need to select those approaches and I think you perfectly mentioned that uh this is

01:02:43	this combination of different things that from one view it might seem very easy but when you dive deeper you clean the data where to collect the data where to store it how to process it how to make the impact how to measure it so I I totally understand then how you could go and grow and you know go through this corporate letter very quickly because early on in your career you had an opportunity to learn and gain all these different skills and I think also for our audience for our aspiring data scientists this is definitely note to

01:03:16	make if they want to grow quickly in their career they need to be prepared to work on their communication skills on their business skills like you did uh on their uh translation skills how to translate from uh business kpis okrs to an actual data science problems on that note since you mentioned very interesting project was there an any particular project in your journey early on when you were data scientist that as a junior meteor that kind of made your career to you know to be um uh to set yourself apart from other ones and be

01:03:55	promoted yeah precisely that's like this this it's actually accumulative I don't say that it's just like one question because like oh maybe I could a little bit to beginning so one of the things that I also try to do during my junior time I feel like a medical is to take an initiative so I not just move I'm not just moving like okay this is your project and then it's like you need to do this and that but even like from My junor Level I I'm not trying to taking like a job like that but it's more like

01:04:28	I try to communicate my boss like I know this is like a really interesting project I want to take it or like I know this is going to be having a good business impact so can we to try to talk and Fa spe the business user this kind of project we could try to create together so this is like uh try to take initiative on my own on my career so I could know where I could try to move during that time but yeah as this is accumul it and this is like one project that I know like uh during that time that this is this is the project

01:05:02	that I done uh is called the the LLP project so it's basically trying to cre create a prediction which of the customer email was a not a spa sorry uh have Cain or not so it's like you know like customer sometimes like really complaining but right yeah but it's not just a complain what we want to try to predict is like is like this this kind of complain could be uh damaging to our reputation or not so this like the kind of the complain TR 3 so in this time uh this kind of project that I undertake is something that uh I

01:05:42	could say try to make on break because like this is about a kind of a project that was done before in our comy at final and then I try to say to the user and my boss that I want to take this kind of project I know this like could be like really useful for our business and then yeah I will try to take a responsibility like from managing this kind of project and it's going it's going well and then it's like yeah even right now uh the business users still what's it call I still want to try to communicate with me for any project but

01:06:17	in the business because I already starting with this kind of project and I try to initiate in it and they still try to approach me if it's like they have like a sub a problem with another initiative that want we done so it start simple it starts just from ourself but this kind of a things will be seen will be seen if like our boss uh colleague by your any uh any business partner and so just take an initiative I think it's like some uh could be like really make on brick your car not just brick it

01:06:52	really make your car understood so kind of be active if you um like you you are already a junior data scientist you already have some basic skills you have worked with some um senior data scientists under supervision couple of months now it's time to take initiative to uh look around uh you know Network and see what kind of projects are on the table and then go and try to make something from even if something seems boring or uninteresting you kind of need to dig deeper like you did right so you

01:07:27	basically identified them and said to your boss well can I work on this and if this is impactful because at the end of the day you will always go to Next Level if you are doing a project if if it has a lot of impact right yes yes that's true and then yeah it's also uh ADV Finly still from my junior level I already if like before if I become data scientist right I already having I know what I want to be I know what I want to do and then when I already become what to do I'm not stopping them I try to

01:08:01	making what is called a master plan basically like this is my going to be my career but I need to take uh into my hand basically this is also what my boss always always said like before like this is like already inspired to me like your carer is in your head your life is in your hand so every kind of movie that you make you need to be responsible for that but it's also need to be something that make you improve as your a person or as your career at anything so that's why I always try to take initiative in

01:08:34	there and it and it worked out right because now you are data science manager you are top voice in data science so it worked out well which is amazing and on that note given your uh nontraditional data science background because you you have background in biology and there are many people out there from our listeners uh also uh who want to make a career change or who come from a non-traditional data science background meaning they don't have a traditional statistics mathematics or data science masters degree um I wanted to uh I

01:09:11	wanted to ask you such you can tell to our audience about the impact that your unique background had on your career it's really interesting yeah because as a biologist before I not using much about really regarding my education like Rel the specific work for example like gy or like a protein of course I not using that in my everyday life but this more about what how I try to methodically thinking during my time of working as a biologist as a researcher really how I structure my work during that time how do I using my

01:09:48	statistic and list I think using that from my biological thinking and and what's it called uh and my education part I think like really taking part like how I could try actually uh break down a lot of like uh the academic because academics you need to like big down like for example like the structure of your work need to be like from uh the theory and then how the methodology and then how this going to be work the result and the cor so all that that I exp previously uh it actually helping working as a data

01:10:26	scientist but of course like I know every person having like a different background I def Le for my because I still from the science part this kind of risk methodology could be really useful during dat as dat stist but I know like there could be like a people coming from the literature for example like coming from the philosophy like com from uh yeah language and then something that really not related to a programming or like really data at all but I think like it's like uh could have like a different

01:10:58	unique perspective as well in there at the fair least uh when you're approaching your work it could be like how do you approach your work do during your study could be applicable the way well you're working at the time but I find least if you have already have the basic I think even if you are not from the data science uh measure so you basically used on your advantage your advantage all your background even if it was a non-traditional data science background yes so what would be your advice to

01:11:34	anyone who um who has this non-traditional background in terms of specific steps yes having a rock M for me is like the best one so I know it's like a little bit a cliche I think I to say but having a rock M to follow is really helpful so there's already a lot in the online like right now like how to become a data scientist step to step First Learning statistic second Lear I third learning the machine learning fourth having like the machine learning project data science project five like try to

01:12:08	apply try to communicate try to uh uh learning the presentation this kind of Step might boring but following those step is actually important because like it really a structur way because like to Pi about data SCI I'm going to say like it just talk small in there but those step like if I statistic programming and machine learning it's going to be uh connected each other to each other the skill and it going to help you to become a data science that you want so just uh follow me the roadm that I already have

01:12:47	it going to be helpful now that you try to learning yourself like jumping here and there try to I emo learning that I try to just learn do those of things but then you forget about the statistic then you forget about the math or you just learning about the programming then forget about the how to presentend it to the business user just uh follow the step one by one and then you I think it could be already good so in organized way basically to follow the road map yeah yeah okay and have a clear plan I suppose yes have had

01:13:19	a clear plan is actually really helpful because like as uh this is like coming from my experience as well because like I try to create a plan for myself to become a data scientist and then I try to follow that plan and it actually work but out not well but this kind of plan that actually I think really helped I def for me because like I know if we are not focusing because this plan can uh this kind of plan actually make you focus because if you are not focusing on that thing you could just go anywhere at that

01:13:54	loose lose your way to becoming like the data side that you want right right no I absolutely agree with you having a clear plan and uh learn in an organized way and not just to go from one course to the other one to try to learn everything that that would be indeed the best way because otherwise they will everyone will be spending ton of time on learning one skill and then there is a new skill to learn by the time they finish another one amazing and uh when it comes to Leading because you are a data science

01:14:27	manager and you have gone through these different steps already and you are leading team what in your opinion uh is that helped you uh to balance the two so the technical side and leading people how do you manage projects and people and uh at the same time uh you driving your career yeah that's really hard I could see but this is like something that I also learned during my corporate time because leading and then try to become an individual contributor I could already said like it's two different

01:15:05	things on one side like uh in the technical part we already understand but become a leader become a lead to the people we need to understand how to delegate how to delegate what kind of the task what kind project and then trust the other that they could actually done it and then by to trusting each other I trust myself and I trust you as a colleague I would said like you are also my friend if like you are uh like I bu but it's also friend that in we are working together in here we are not just like boss and to okay you do this you do

01:15:41	that and you are okay bye no but we are trying to communicate together what are the problem in here what how we could try to working together in this here but I try to not to back from my nature like I try to jumping in there doing every stuff like you do but trusting the people and the delegate to the people is actually really important but it's coming from the learning of course of course like as an individual contributor and I still really love encoding I still love programming I do it right now I tell doing right now I

01:16:13	really want to JP get like doing this border leag and stuff uh at any time but trusting the others is like it's a learning learning to managing this project it could be you could do this and then learning that I could actually uh doing this stuff uh much better when I actually already being in this SP right now but so yeah it's it's still alar process for me I could say like it's still alarming is uh never ending journey I could say but delegating to the people that I trust having a Trust basically to the other is like the

01:16:52	important to balancing things on that note because um maybe some of our listeners who are inspiring uh tech people and who haven't worked in the field they don't know this concept of individual contributor what you just mentioned because for anyone who knows who doesn't know this term uh we have usually these two different career paths right in data science when you just join you can uh you usually join as an individual contributor so you work on the technical Stu and once you go through your career there's usually two

01:17:25	ways to go one is the uh individual career and as an um uh individual contributor and the other one is the managerial path which I assume is the one that you are following because you are managing people yeah so um that's about that uh you mentioned working as an individual contributor and then now you are manager which means that you are managing people and supervising them and on the note of the trust because that's something that you mentioned a lot when explaining your leadership skills to trusting in others but how do you build

01:17:58	trust as a data scientist when you have just joined your data science uh job yes he my proof I think because that's what I do to build the trust with my boss in my colleague I Pro that in my job I could actually do this and I try to present how my result is going to be and then I try to ProActive at my work trust is not built just like by you saying but trust is built by you are having a proof of your work trust is coming from the things that you already did is from the action itself I know like communicating is maybe not that

01:18:37	easy as well but just by but your work is your uh it's like a promise in there during that time so I know like as a junior data scientist like yeah I I can do it I can do it I can do it I said I can do it like that and I know like uh people that I is like yeah I can do it but how's they work so it is that's actually that that that that work that actually making that uh the proof of the trust so as a jur I think the best way is like yeah just do the work if like a smaller like as you said previously

01:19:13	youly like this might be boring stuff it might be an assum it might be not leading anywhere but those kind of work show that you could actually do the work rather than just so get the work done basically yeah get the work done right right that makes sense so then you can build the trust uh make sure that you help your supervisor because that's at the end of the day the job of the data scci Junior data scientist to help uh the senior data scientists and other leaders in the team to make their life easier whether it's

01:19:46	unfortunately data uh collection data analysis or not and um on the note of uh leading the teams and becoming manager in your opinion um how can one decide whether they want to take the path towards individual contributor so become a principal data scientist and then stay like an individual contributor or they should consider the path uh towards becoming a manager data science manager what qualities uh do you need to have to go towards One path or the other I think it's coming from yourself because every

01:20:25	single person have like a different evaluation right about what they kind want to be like for example for my site I love both side I already said like I love both side like as individual contributor as they leading I love both of them so I want to try to actually experience having like this experience as a leader as well so because I already have a experience as a different contributor that's why I try to move in to that site as well to try to leadership part but of course like it's coming back to your start again what do

01:20:56	you want to do in your future because like I cannot tell like for as every single person that you need to be like become a manager is the best path because it's like have to was money or like become is much better because it's like really coming to yourself or like your comfort zone where you want to be in the future so it need to become to yourself I mean like every single puff car way have their pro and con it's always like that it's just like the decision that you already make you need to responsible for that

01:21:26	that makes sense so what it is to be a data science manager um walk us through your kind of day today uh your responsibilities for the listeners to get an idea what it means to be a data science manager yes uh unique in my place I would say like still leing the them of course like having to having like a me like the thems and then having like managing the project what what's our project right now what the what's how how is it going and then uh how is the progressing so it's like managing the progress of the work in there and then

01:22:04	try to balance it with the business user what their expectation is and then translate it into our technical so could be actually making those kind of progress so it's like balancing with everybody uh from every side as well so I will say like those kind of work that I usually like the DayDay so managing uh the people like how what you going to be like in this week or what going to be in this day or and then they try to when the business us are coming how do we going to make this project uh successful right so that's day to day

01:22:42	basically that makes sense so managing people lot of communication meetings so that's definitely also part of the managerial position that's for sure so if you don't like meeting and you don't like communicating with product people and business people you should not choose for death path right that's true that's true that's yeah I could I would say like that's the Kong because like I could say like if you see my calendar of course like the this meeting it could be like 8 nine 10 12 it could be like this

01:23:15	L and then it's like Suddenly It's like uh random me what what do I need the J me I this for yeah yeah for sure now I heard that a lot so that's something for our listeners to take into account when choosing which career path they need to go through and on the note of the projects because uh you have been leading projects and you have been also going through the corporate letter successfully as your da science manager now at such a young age can you uh remember maybe there is like a one project an impactful one that you end up

01:23:56	uh going through it was a tough project but you uh with your team have completed it and what were the main takeaways from it uh this like so project but I think what the really impactful right now if like still we still ongoing right now is like we try to create this kind like a cent fraud detection project so basically it's like Afric need like a fraud detection model this is like oh are really really impactful to the business because like you know like truck usually not happening that often but when it is happen it could be

01:24:33	damaging the financial damage into the reputation damage into thebody on their business and then yeah this is like really ongoing project that need a lot of consideration like coming from this kind of business like this customer like where the data set is coming from so it's like really involving a lot of obious stakeholder and then a lot of a technical person uh to be involved so this kind of project that we are doing uh I will say like taking a lot of people come and go because like if like this is like really hard project but at

01:25:10	the fin list uh I would say it's like making an impact because like the business use use business us are using it and then they try ad try to trust our result but there's always a lot of room for Improv one because like uh I I said before a for detection as really that could be really damaging if we could not do it uh properly so we need to present those result from this CL FR to be something that could be understable by the business so we try to create the model as Qui as possible we need to have like

01:25:45	the explainability as Qui as possible we need to integrate all the business process as possible so those Ming part really uh really right now are still in uh the project that I really remember until now that I try to even uh try to what's it called uh in another project those kind of work that I done there I try to implement it in in the other because it's just like this kind of complexity really need to be uh Tak consideration okay amazing sounds as a tough problem fraud detection um it it if you have a high error rate uh that

01:26:27	can seriously impact your operations also uh this about money uh that we are talking about after all uh and on the node of money so uh you have gone uh through this different steps you start as a junior data scientist usually or as an intern in data science if you don't have any background at all and you haven't complete any projects and then you need to go through the steps usually you become a metor data science and then you become um a senior data scientist and you become then a data science

01:27:01	manager like you are today so what it takes to get a promotion is it only the technical side building that trust like you just said making an impact or you also need to actively promote yourself because I know it really is different from companies to companies but uh there are some common qualities is that differentiate data scientists who stay in the same role for many years even if they have a very uh good skill set versus the data scientists who very quickly like yourself go through the different steps and get promoted a

01:27:41	lot yes I think like you the corporate yeah I said before it's really depend on the business as well of course I because promotion only coming uh first if there's like a business set if you want like a business position to be filled that's the first stage of course like you want to like having like a really higher position it might not go as fast as mine if you have if your company doesn't even need it but for promotion basically for a promotion that increase your money uh increase your financial security

01:28:16	increasing that I I believe that's the most important part actually the financial I think like for most the people like I know like some people doesn't want G it to be promoted but they just want to have like a higher salary but they big title but in like my the bigger biggest quality that yeah of course like I said before like taking initiative I discuss it with my manager what my career I want to be as well I want to be like I said in before like can I get a promotion I yeah as us like at the time like and

01:28:53	they try uh and then they they the what's it called uh negotiate basically yeah yeah we can do it like in this uh of time with with your kind of pro proof of work we already been everything that already I done I already show it because like but I had thought just like six month no I just I'm not saying that I in six month I said I can promoted no but I try to build it during a time but it's actually like a year that I to to to the med to see here I I ask I ask so it's really like an Initiative for because you don't even

01:29:31	know like yeah is it like a possible or not if you are not asking I know like some company culture is like a little bit T do like right like like so like it's like really shy or like like if some people are just too shy but it's is depend on culture in the company because like again my company at the my Bo is like really open it doesn't matter if you want to you ask to be promoted or not it's like sh we open discussion but for the company that are a little bit stret like a little bit a t in that

01:30:08	part yeah you need to take a little bit proactive but showing you are the best in your work showing that if like compare to your colleague yeah I am the number one in there I I I would say this is a b competition I will stay if you are to be in the car to it's still a competition very if you put it as a competition but it's like a really healthy competition you want to get a in that okay amazing so basically don't be shy to ask because if you don't ask you might not get it read the room meaning

01:30:45	you need to know who your bus is whether he is open or he is not open to uh a conversation like that so understand the company culture whether it's fine to promote yourself and uh kind of build that negotiation skill set right to negotiate for whether it's higher salary or Better Business title because sometimes that's also important uh for for your position in the company but do that on time meaning before that show your work and only with right cards go and promote yourself right yes yes you need to have a

01:31:20	strategy basically for that like a plan to that but yeah I know like it's uh take a time take a skill like uh to do that I know like not everyone will actually bre enough to do that or like uh having like AAL thinking to do that everyone is different but of course like you could try to copy a little bit people strategy I know like online like if like what I said right now if you want to copy my strategy like even after a year after you work hard you already taking initiative you ask your boss then when a

01:31:54	work you could try to copy mind if you uh cly actually having a little bit white mind could be like a reop okay so that that's a very good advice I think to not show away to ask and know your strategy plan in advance yes on the note on that planning and uh on a personal branding so planning your personal brand now Cornelius you have a huge following you are top voice on LinkedIn and you have uh about 30,000 followers on LinkedIn right almost almost 30,000 still almost almost yes if you listening now go and follow

01:32:35	Cornelius maybe we can 30,000 yes so how important it is to have a personal brand as a data scientist yes it's actually very important so I will talk offset of my work because like of course it's school but offset of my work it give me a lot of chance anwers it giv me a lot of opportunity like right now with you I'm talking with you because I already have a personal branding right you know yeah understand it's opening a lot of door so I get a lot of new friends lot of new ning lot of a current opportunity that uh offset of my job so

01:33:14	try to a lot of freelances lot of writings I love writing so I try to focusing myself as in the writing as well because like some of the people because content creator who actually do like a video so actually doing a Tik Tok for example on Instagram photo but I love article writing I have like a newsleter I try to make myself personal branding in there as a data scientist not writing and those do uh make my career actually have it like I don't say it's a side hustle anymore because it's already my hustle is become become my

01:33:50	personal hustle that b uh improve my come Financial Security so this person branding have make you having like a more car choices it could make you a lot of CH because like like this uh I read a lot about uh people who like a business entrepreneur they usually not only have like one source of income they have like a multiple they buing here and there and I see like this coming actually from the personal branding as well they could actually coming to have like this kind of a source of income multiple because

01:34:28	they promote themsel like myself like I try to promote data scientist who know some of the stuff in the data science world and then yeah the opportunity keep coming as because start promoting here and there and then try to having which uh car this choice that could actually make in the future at first it's the door opening it's uh more so uh in the case that maybe someday I could lay off or something you never know in the company you never know what could happen if like it might POS like something like s secure right now maybe

01:35:08	in the future something like this like a Cris financial crisis being L off like or even like a pandemic before like people that who since like Financial Security suddenly getting C off work I I see my personal B right now as a security me as well that I could try to make it uh a runway in the case of something that happening as well so that's really yeah for sure because like you just mentioned uh in many parts of the world also currently there are many data scientists that are being laid off just

01:35:43	because of the economic structure and uh like you the message what you are also giving to our audience is that your personal brand will not just be uh something uh for uh you know for for that scenario but also for uh for for for just in general it opens many doors for you new opportunities new networks new contacts and also in case something happens so uh you are being terminated laid up for some reason then uh that will be a great way for you uh to have a source of income so not to put all your eggs in one basket that's the

01:36:23	message you are giving right right Bally yes very precisely and on the note of your newsletter because you have a popular newsletter and it is called non-brand Data can you tell us more about that yes at first yeah I just call it non brand because like is is really in the early year or I try to create a just letter and branding so I try to just not want to boxing myself in those of branding that I could to be a data engineering or like a data scientist like the nalp or stuff to I could try so this kind of us

01:37:00	could talk about anything but and Rel to data but at the moment right now I try to talk more about a things like first about more about a carrier so like a business the carrier in as data scientist like those tips and that's like uh my opinion but and the second one is talking more about uh the technical stuff so I try to also still putting my technical uh knowledge uh in my newsletters so I'm try talking about the python M op and how to integrade it so basically I try to combine like I still understanding the business but

01:37:38	understanding programming stuff Time stuff in there it's still uh it a data sici juice letter that try to make you as a car uh that scientist to improve your career dis amazing so if you are listening now okay make sure to check the non-brand data newsletter from Cornelius hit the Subscribe button and you will get a lot of help with uh your career how to start a data science career and also the technical stuff like Cornel just mentioned yes also uh let's talk about the coaching that you do because you

01:38:12	have a topmate um uh link uh and also uh way to provide your knowledge so to coach other aspiring data scientists or people who are already the field can you tell us more about what kind of coaching you do yes so it's more about how you could move as a data scientist the carer where do you want to move I like I said before we to manag I to more to the indidual contributor but basically how do you want to move as data scientist in your career but of course it is also open I open to coaching as like from non

01:38:51	uh data s yet that you want to move breaking into data science Field opening for the coaching for that as well amazing so if you're looking for a coach then uh make sure to get in touch with Cornelius uh he might be able to help you with your career but also the technical part yes uh he's on the top mate so we will put the link uh in the description so on the note of the person branding let's say uh you have a person who comes and ask for your coaching services or just in general your advice uh you have a huge personal brand at the

01:39:26	moment huge following on LinkedIn what would be your advice more in actionable way how to build a personal brand from scratch yes I will come from my personal experience first I first I'm networking first actually before I post anything much about that well I already before I coming up with the plan of what I want to be I that this I know what I know then I try to uh building that those going to be my brand those about data scientist in here then I tried to have like a networking like a so the first

01:40:09	time that I posting it uh my social media and of course like it's not going to be like having like a lot of that reading it and how like you L of people that noten yet but that's why I try to actually also approaching people that actually already having those big follower so I have like right now my friend like his name is Carin but he's already not that much active right now in the L in but he's the first one that I helping me going to the network into the data science Fielding in as a data scientist and then

01:40:45	because of his follower I get another follower as well and then I start getting more and more momentum in there so it's just like Anno my brand then try to networking with those people who are actually already uh having those number basically I would say it's a number game if you will say it but I three consistent I consistently still posting it from my uh it's already been five years I think I still consistent until now try to posting something stuff even if like I know like one of the things that uh make people kind of share way

01:41:24	after they posting their first post is there doesn't have like a lot of people that might be liking them or like a comment to their content but no I mean like just keep posting it I mean like every single post that you have might be pable for someone you might thinking that this of course might not ah this is like just too easy lot people already know but no maybe someone is actually reading your content and understand okay this is how do you do it okay people uh do that I I think about that before okay

01:42:01	like not much l but there's a people actually say Thank you regarding my post and then it's like okay that actually make my Vol higher but the first that it might not showing that much but just keep consistent posting because it's like it take take a mental I think like for take a mental fortitude to keep posting if like your sitation is not that much but of course it's take a strategy still take a strategy to improve your social media and personal branding so what I think going to be like before

01:42:39	having a with your personal brand having the network and then keep consistent I think those three is already being good enough if you want to building person brand amazing so if you if you are someone who is listening and who who doesn't yet have any personal brand uh following these steps will help you to uh gain that personal brand uh online but also offline um so on that note Cornelius um do you think that uh having uh like coaching um services having a newsletter and having a LinkedIn following uh is that enough for your

01:43:19	personal brand and of course also networking or are there any other uh Media or channels that you usually use in order to uh build your personal rent as a technical person I'm talking about for example GitHub you know um place to um store and uh create and showcase your Cod also to Showcase how you can tell a story about data yes yes that's true like geub is like uh really just T the community for a data not even dat just like a programmer to have like those portolio to be showed in there but also for

01:43:58	myself because I a writer previously uh and I just but really writing I using medium to hosting all my uh article I'm still quite active there if uh but right now is a little bit more in the my newsletter but depending on your fion I think like a strategy you need to yeah uh need to a little bit branching so far example like my side go to medium and GitHub but maybe for example like for some people that would like video maybe you could try to have like pres sense in the YouTube or like in the Tik Tok

01:44:33	because I know like some friend in there uh some of my friend is actually really active in the Tik Tok compared to the uh Linkin but uh it's really need to understand as well what the audience what your audience want to be uh sorry what you want the audience you want the audience that so for example like I like Ling in because it's like a really professional places like a social platform so there's not a lot of professional uh Communication in there so that's why I really active there try to build my building personal brand

01:45:07	there but maybe your personal branding want to Target more more casual people then maybe X may be better places so I know like a lot of people in The X like a big dat people in there as well there's a lot of follow I try to post here and there as well in ad but it's more most actually in basa Indonesia so maybe a little bit harder for not Indonesia speaker but yeah uh think but if you was just starting try to focus on one platform first having like a one platform social media then try to build from there then try to branch in there

01:45:43	but like GitHub like medm I think that's just the medium way just the places to show me portolio so I think it's like more about where you can show you working but if you want to uh I think it's like uh complimenting complimenting your personal brand that you already building in the social media like GitHub medium or right some other uh it's like for portfol but starting uh your starting places then try to focus there C on there I think that's one important part I think that's an amazing advice to

01:46:16	keep it simple because sometimes it can be overwhelming if you have so many social media or different channels that you need to keep up with it will you will just run out of time or you will burn out so sort simple basically that's what you are saying and then they will all start to complement each other so either ex or Tik Tok or GitHub medium or um different other places LinkedIn uh Facebook so it really depends on your uh Target profile like you just mentioned yes amazing let's now dive deep uh

01:46:53	become bit more technical because data science is such a buzz word there are people who understand data science as data analytics there are people who understand dat science as this machine learning engineer and um with the uh revolution of AI now there are many people who understand data scientist as someone who is dealing with L mops large language models deep learning machine learning so many parts that um many data scientists across the world are learning and are implementing now in your opinion

01:47:28	as a data science manager with the wealth of knowledge and experience in the field what is for you the data scientist and what it takes to be a data scientist yes this is still a question that I actually still asking data scientist previously I said it's a someone who working with the data to bring a Val into the business but right now is moving much more than that as well so it's like data SST is someone who bring the value to the business and making the decision for the better any business but I always set a business

01:48:06	because like a data scientist uh always need a business to working with because like even if you're a Sol prer a solst your product will be need to be a promoted in some way then they have like some business value so that's why I always said but right now data scien is not just something that Mis value but also someone who bring a better decision in the business but yeah to become a data scientist I would say it takes a lot of uh mental foret so like take a consistency taking a what to learn all

01:48:45	the way every day every years every time always for system learning right and I was like problem buiness I already said it before so I don't need to repeat it again but yeah just keep want to keep learning and keep up with the new latest technology this technology latest technology I believe in myself I believe all that it's going through chance to work it's going to chance to work like I'm I right now it's going through chance to work this day so as a data scientist try to keep following that technology because if you not following

01:49:22	that technology we will be yeah as I said being replaced basically side this we have like an advantage because we are usually working for creating that AI complimenting that AI right so Che on that note I think you already answered my question because I wanted to ask you do you think that AI is a password many people think that this new era of generative AI chat GPT you know Cloud LMS it's a hype it will just go away but you just answered that in your opinion it's not going to uh going away anytime soon and it's going

01:50:04	to make a huge impact so can you uh walk us through some of the recent developments that you are aware of and you believe are going to make a huge impact and in which industry specifically in your opinion yes uh if you want to talk about technology like oh yeah we already have like a lot of generation the open I already have like a lot of the model that really good like the like the cloud is also we have a really great you see like day and then I to I feel like if like Sora right now already try to I just image the the

01:50:43	video but right now what I really see is like the business are so like the non technical people because right now it's like the implementation is like just like recording or for a little simple stuff but right now like a business people start to see how useful is that like a lot of not just lot technical people but like of non technical people who are try to build a product based on that so yeah it just from my set so uh this P two weeks two weeks I already did like a lot of uh stakeholder basically

01:51:17	is this India like a big St on actually they want to try to building this kind of product and I try to using this uh AI to simplify their business process basically is like if like in if like in Indonesia they already see the potential that it could be used but of course like right now it's our job as well like as data scientist to prove that this kind of AI to be actually useful in the VIS it's not just like the business want to use it and then they try to uh make it effort from their side but we as a data

01:51:54	scientist need to make an effort as well that yes this AI could be useful for your business and that it could be like as a proove that this two things that combin together business and is like become big it could be like become a game changer so but yeah that's why I really quite really confident that like I could actually change the world because it's not just uh I personally using it and then try to get a benefit from that but also everyone that I I like from my side is actually already starting using it

01:52:28	and they try to implement it in their business and that is actually useful well that's amazing to hear because I am trying when when I'm hearing talks about AI will replace data scientists I feel like um that's something that uh can is highly arguable so um first I want to take uh your uh opinion on this do you think AI would replace data scientists and um how can you future prove yourself as a data scientist yes I think it's not going to replace holy I think it's more like about some of the job that we not yes

01:53:09	some of the task that we for example like maybe B detection or like uh Co generation it could be like delegated to do AI but of course like restructuring all the where is the bus is going to be using it and then where it's going to be managed it's still taking a data scientist to do that but that's why it's the data set just become evolving right because like those task could be replaced by AI we as a data scientist need to Evol us well we are not just need to understand how to coding it well but you need to

01:53:47	understand how to manage discod better we to actually document it better we need to understand where is going to be in the business which going to be used which of us or data scientist is going to be really using this AI so all this latest technology we need to understand as well so but is what I want to say like data say need to become a full step and that is like cannot be avoidable on basically like like like my PA as well like I try to learn a lot of Ops operationalization I don't think it's

01:54:23	going to be replaced by uh as well because to the structure could be be that yeah I couldn't said better because um being able to become this full stock professional that you know both the data side the machine learning side the Deep learning but also the recent developments in AI kind of at least high level to know what LM is what LM Ops is those Cloud Technologies how they can be used right yes and have also the business acument and the communication because if the uh product um there's always communication right business

01:55:03	versus data scientist there's always a need for the translation and um as long as you are able to do so and continuously develop yourself with the technology there is no way that you will be replaced because by the way the other day I was reading that um currently uh there is an 85% gap between uh the demand for data science and AI professionals versus the supply so unless you are doing a manual job I always tend to say that unless you do something repetitively that can be replaced by AI you are good to go yes so

01:55:37	you should definitely have a motivation to get into data science if you like it on the note of getting into data science because you are now in the position of hiring data scientists so what are the skill set that you are paying attention at because with this recent Buzz llms generative AI many aspiring data scientists uh instead of starting with fundamentals they start um with a difficult stuff training neural networks understanding RNN attention mechanisms Transformers diffusion models and then

01:56:12	uh try to show with this project that they are uh an experienced professional what do you pay attention at when you are hiring and you are getting this different resumes okay so the first thing that I don't pay attention much first thing that I don't actually pay attention much is actually where the university is or where the GPA is or their age is or their background is like I If you out that but I the finist those kind of discriminative I the do so I try to make everyone qu in the in the K but of

01:56:51	course like when you are in a business there like a business needs so the first thing of course like filling up the business needs uh when it's like a hiring and as a data scientist that what I I do that I see for a junior data scientist I want to see if you could actually do the work so basically have you already at uh least do some data science project already created some data project data science project and therefore this data science project helps your uh tough process going how's your what what uh motivated

01:57:27	you to do this kind of project what motivated you to do uh this kind of code what motivated you to present this kind of result so this data science project is actually what I really see of course like uh having like an internship experience having like uh job experience previously really uh us it up I see that as well but of course like uh I know like this a little bit hard for engineer uh sorry asir fans to become up Eng because like the position is like really hard to feel so that's why I try to add the

01:58:03	finist taking a look at the data science portolio project so that's the those the the most important part that I try to TT in for like like a communication like a business equipment like for a trans to the business I think those kind of a skill that I think will be you learn when you are already being in a business inside the business but when you are to enter in the business you need to at least show that you can work for the T that you are going to be hiring for and understand but but of course like

01:58:37	understanding a little bit of a is uh really helpful it's still really helpful it's a plus yeah there is a plus it's a plus going but my standard point is like showing your data science portolio showing that you could actually do the work that's what the mind right so a strong data science portfolio basically you learn the data science communication translation skills business acument all plus but extra but for you as a hiring manager during the hiring process you pay attention at the projects that they have completed unless

01:59:12	they have already in experience yes and so on that note uh what would you suggest like couple of examples of such projects that um you would suggest an aspiring data scientist who have zero experience just fresh out of college maybe even nonre and data science Ed education to put on their resume to impress you there's a lot I mean like a lot of people that are impress me because so smart but it's like uh you think like uh I there like a lot of thata but uh that you can try to find it in the kle or

01:59:54	like UCI those kind of little bit complex data science project but what will really impress me if you actually could formulate a business problem from those data sites data set and then formulate why youve develop this kind of modeling and then this model that you develop is actually solving or even not using a modeling are you actually using the data set no you don't need a model but I have you can formulate a business problem from this and then you try to useing the data science technique maybe just a

02:00:27	clustering technique maybe just a customer Dimension reduction technique but Co actually showing that this is how I could solve the problem from my business problem that I already formulate with this data set and then I showing you that this is like how I do it so that's the one that I really impress me because like what I want to see in your data science project portolio is basically the top process and usually the top process will coming instantly when you already have like this business problem that you want to

02:00:57	uh solve but of course like uh the the data set that already available in the public is maybe a little bit limited but of course like within this limited data set if you could be creatively thinking about a problem and then try to solve it it will be P Miss right so from end to end basically and also have kind of this extra skill set then just solving the problem in technical way yes solving a problem in a technical way you can say that amazing and one last question because we spoken about many important topics that I

02:01:35	believe uh many aspiring data scientists would be interested in uh what do you see as the future of data science in the upcoming Five Years well we going to change a lot I think like with this all AI development and data technical stuff that everywhere I know like in five years data size will be invaluable to the business like I said before AI is like is like a buw previously but is a bus that used by the business and if the business could actually use using it bets in the company in this five year if it is five

02:02:14	year they will try to hiire as much as the data SST just to making that sure that this is going uh smoothly and then I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure like this is in this five years will be using a lot of automation from our uh from data science uh technique amazing now Cornelius thank you so much for joining us today I think uh your insights and all your tips were uh invaluable for our listeners who are interested in Tech and in data science uh for our listeners make sure to follow Cornelius on LinkedIn but also

02:05:51	by the way good to see you good to uh good to be here with all your listeners out there um you know I I think for all of us life is a journey and it's a building of a set of experiences that make us who we are as a young person I served in the US military um service in the military taught me something about discipline teamwork leadership uh engineering uh engineering made me a meticulous planner um I'm a pilot Pilots don't take off unless we know where we're going so that taught me how as an entrepreneur to plan an exit from the

02:06:22	beginning you know and always have an exit and a destination in mind uh I spent 10 years working for Jack Welsh in the uh Camelot era of uh ge I call it um GE was the world's number one largest company Fortune number one on the Fortune 500 list company was growing so fast it was doubling in size every three years and that that really informed my thinking about growth and GE taught me how to run a business then I spent 21 years as a CEO building three different National companies for nine different

02:06:52	private Equity firms um bought 58 companies a buy and build guy a turnaround guy and uh you know I've got2 and a half billion dollars in uh in CEO exits under my belt um that kind of led me to writing books you know about how to do this I I wanted to educate I'm turning 60 here shortly and I I I wanted to start thinking about you know Legacy and how how you know I wanted to teach the next generation of entrepreneurs and business owners how to excel at this game at this thing you know that that's

02:07:25	been so influenced by private equity and you know that kind of kind of led me to hanging up my CEO cleats a couple years ago I started a Consulting business I've got clients all over the globe uh I helped them with uh with scaling uh with doing m&a teaching them the tricks that that the big institutional investors use to create shareholder wealth and then um you know I help people exit I work with private Equity firms I work with individual and Founders I'm having a ball I work more hours now than I ever

02:07:55	did when I was a CEO so so much for uh for for slowing down I I think I've actually speed it up awesome and um can you share a few stories on how you acquired new businesses and grew them and sold them like the top businesses you worked on well so so usually in my world again I've been doing this with large institutional shareholders and so they always start with what's called a platform company so they're going to buy a b a business and that'll be the base and then on top of that base we're going

02:08:28	to add other you know other businesses to try to help it grow you know exponentially faster so if I take my last company as an example um the the company that I was hired to run so private Equity Firm buys a company it's a platform company it has 200 million plus in Revenue uh they buy it with a combination of debt and Equity from their fund uh and then they they bring me in the company has not done well you know and time to bring in the guy to turn it around to fix it to get it scaling again and then start doing a a

02:09:01	buy and build and so I then bought 23 companies over a five-year period uh I bought I bought eight total in the first hold period 15 in the second and uh you know and started bolting on these other businesses to go from being Regional to National National to International depending on which company I was building at at the time and in addition to to Growing through m&a also then would focus on on improving the business that I started with so usually investing in technology trying to do my best to

02:09:36	increase the revenues the profitability um you know and and you know of the base business and then also a lot of effort around organic growth to get the business that that was underwhelming and not not doing really well to grow like it had never grown before organ mechanically and so I've learned how to build I'll say a very balanced growth oriented company but no question that m& is the largest component of shareholder value creation and on that example those 23 companies that that we bought you

02:10:09	know on average I paid five times for each one of the companies they were small they were plentiful or smaller plentiful and and I used 100% Bank debt to buy those 23 companies and I use the cash flow of the 23 businesses to you know service the debt while I'm collecting them buying them and then when we go to market we sell it and we sold for the first time a multiple of around 14 times and so things I was buying at five times I'm now selling it 14 times and you know the net result is you know a tremendous amount of

02:10:43	shareholder value created then you add in the organic growth you add in the margin Improvement and that's kind of my recipe for the perfect exit you know in that case in my first exit the the the three-year period uh it was a 4ex multiple of invested Capital so shareholders were happy investors were happy management team was thrilled we made a ton of money you know and uh when it when when things go well and um so as you know like in the tech industry the creating uh value wealth is the the opportunity is immense

02:11:21	that it's also like very competitive like we have many fresh graduates coming straight out of University and trying to make a new business a new startup but they have no idea how to do this so what strategy or what mindset would you recommend them for our ambitious Tech entrepreneurs who want to get their food in the field yeah so Tech is an entirely different world you know you have to get to different concepts um you know software as a service you know or for uh a tech enabled platform definitely

02:11:55	brings a higher valuation call it an exit um but often times from a tech startup perspective I'd say that a lot of people out there are trying to create the new next best thing and oftentimes I I tell people it's like instead of trying to create something new that doesn't yet exist um potentially solve uh an old problem or or put a new spin on something that's already out there and you know I think too often it's like we we try too hard as entrepreneurs to create something new differentiated that

02:12:25	the world's never seen before and sometimes boring old problems still need help and still need solving you know and they can be updated and solved in a new modern fashion and and so I I I think sometimes entrepreneurs overthink complexity um and so when when I when I am talking to people about what constitutes a great company you know I tell them to think about human basic needs think about needs versus wants in a bad economy in a down economy if my business is focused on needs I'm not going to get hurt as bad my revenue

02:12:59	streams will be be still fairly consistent um but if my if my product or my service is is a want then if I'm laid off or I'm unemployed or I'm feeling a pinch from high interest rates you know I can slow down I can avoid or I can completely ignore that spend for a you know for an extended period of time until the economy comes back and so we have to be concerned with just the cyclicality of of of the broader economies you know in the world we go through up Cycles we go through down Cycles you know and and the world can

02:13:33	throw us curveballs like covid and so we we have to be very thoughtful around if we're going to start something I want it to be needs-based so you know it's like if if my if my roof was leaking and it's raining outside and I'm in my house you know and water is pouring on my head I have to fix that whether I'm broke or not you know but if I wanted to put new fancy you know accessories on my big monster truck out there um you know if I'm unemployed and I don't have any money then I just look at the magazine

02:14:03	and dream about what I would do but I don't have the money and so I don't do it you know it's a it's a discretionary spend so needs versus wants then we want subscription based versus I'll call it Project based we want some type of a a product that customers are going to pay us a monthly fee for it's talking to me if I go to my credit card statements and I look for all the monthly fees I'm paying you know for Adobe Acrobat and for Google cloud and for Apple this or that and it's like I spend you know a a

02:14:34	fortune every month in just these recurring you know contracted type charges and you know that's also the key to entrepreneurial success once I find a customer I want to create a recurring Revenue stream you know even in games people might have a free game but there's in in inapp purchases to help augment you know and so if I'm thinking from a tech perspective needs versus wants contracted Revenue stream versus one-time use or Project based and uh you know and and then I'm thinking you know in a perfect world low capital

02:15:08	expenditure um not a lot of money to to further develop or refine a product once it's created and uh you know and it's it's creating a profile like that that leads to high profit profitability High free cash flow and with high free cash flow comes the ability to service a lot of debt which means buyers who want to use debt as a primary funding source they can uh they can service a lot of debt because there's a lot of cash flow so if you can build a business with high free cash flow you know that's focused

02:15:39	on needs not wants you know and uh and as a recurrent contracted Revenue stream you're going to do much much better yeah now that's that's a great advice like often times entrepreneurs were start working on some kind of new project they think they are like working on solving a problem in a certain way but actually they're like not solving like any form of new problem and they end up hitting like a wall where where they are like but is isn't already someone else doing that when they talk to an investor yeah sometimes boring you know

02:16:13	Industries and we we solve a problem there but they're a a staple you know or a Mainstay of an economy um you we we we can get a lot better traction you know when we solve a a a common problem for common people rather than create a new problem that someone doesn't know they have yet and then have to convince them they need our product to solve that problem yeah 100% And with um startups like many startups like need human capital they need like some kind of um Capital to be able to employ uh new people to be able to uh

02:16:51	invested in marketing or in other resources now build building trust is very important with investors because they want know that they are investing in someone that's trustful and they're able to not only get their money back but also get multiple returns so how would you advice on new people entering the field on building um trust with investors well this is the ageold problem and the age-old question right so chicken or the egg I have no Revenue but I need people you know Venture Capital investor says I don't want to

02:17:29	give you a bunch of capital that you're going to waste you know on the come you know I need you to be able to prove you know proof of concept and prove that you can can actually create these revenue streams so it's a very delicate balance and it makes startups a very difficult place to to to to be you know and and oftentimes I I I ask myself do I want to build or do I want to buy and I'll I'll look at the existing Market in place you know and I'll say look if I start from scratch I have a very high probability

02:17:58	of failure um I I have a a lot of hurdles that I'm going to have to to cross and I might ask myself is there an existing company that has the existing technology or has the existing product that I can buy that's pre-existing and as a result I've got a company that has Revenue customers a history of profitability and then it's a different game you know so in the startup world we use things like Founders equity and and we we we try to attract people by by telling them you know how rich they're going to be one day down the road in the

02:18:32	future and that's a hard sell you know and I I got to tell you I get contacted constantly with people who want to offer me Founders Equity to to help them and you know what I work for cash flow I don't work for Founders Equity uh and when I'm sitting on the boards of companies they give me stock anyway so I I get I get stock in an existing company with real Revenue real customers you know and I get cash flow and so I personally won't work in a tech type startup world where there's Founders Equity involved so I I think we have to

02:19:03	be realistic and and we we have a we have to profile so anytime I need people you know my goal and objective is to hire the best people I can find for the company that I want to be in five years not the company I am today you know and part of my tenants include I have to pay a fair market wage but if I can't because I'm I'm cash constrained then the only tool I've got is incentive Equity to try to attract people and then my profile might change you know I I may not be looking for an established

02:19:34	executive who's used to making seven figures a year because I have no money to pay them and so I'm looking for a different profile it's a younger person it's an upand cominging person it's a person with great skills but they live in their mother's basement you know or they live in an apartment and their cost structure is low they don't yet have kids they're not yet married and as a result of that you know I can attract them with the equity potential and the lack of of cash flow because their their

02:20:05	needs are lower you know it's like I I'm a seven figure you know eight figure guy every year and so you it's like I I I don't work for free I don't work for Equity that may or may not pay off in 10 years I work for cash and Equity you know and so you know we we have to think about the talent that we need and where are we going to find it and how are we going to attract it and retain it and so we have to build a profile for the type of person that we think would be uniquely qualified to go on this

02:20:36	entrepreneurial Journey with us um especially when we're cash constrained in the beginning and we just don't have the right level of capital so I need Brilliance on a budget and I'm going to look for a profile of a person who's got low cash flow needs to where my my small poultry salary will in in you know at least cover their basic needs because they have cheap basic needs but brilliant skills and they're trying to become you know call it the next tech you know Tech billionaire or multi-millionaire they'll believe in the

02:21:06	journey and they'll take and call it use Sweat Equity to get there um now in your experience how do um successful companies balance Innovation with Su sustainable growth like for example we have like a lot of businesses that are innovating but they like they keep on innovating and in an unsustainable way a small Tech entrepreneur who's trying to create something that has you know a a a legs I'll call it something that has longlasting ability to build a sustainable Revenue in future um at some point we have to shift entrepreneurial

02:21:47	gears and say it's good enough it's good enough for now and our Focus needs to be scaling and then the Innovation or investment you know we we we we don't necessarily want to stop but we do need to throttle back so if I've gotten to a proof of concept you know I'm out in the marketplace you know there is a point where we have to be thinking about well if I continue to spend money I don't have you know innovating innovating innovating while this is important I'm never going to build a sustainable

02:22:18	business if I don't also keep my eye on the ball and the fact that my investors need to see a return and I need to create you know revenue and so as I get out of the gates I get out of the market when I start to start to see Revenue coming in it's like we really have to drive Revenue hard and show sustainable high levels of Revenue growth and the high margins that that that were we were hoping for and we have to demonstrate this and and so our you know we have a lot of initial effort to to call it on

02:22:48	the technology side to innovate and create the product once we get out and launch that needs to to scale back and our efforts need to be replaced by focusing on marketing and sales and building the revenue stream we have to remember in order to build the best business in the world it still has to be fed with cash and investors eventually will run out of patience and pull out the rug from under us if we can't prove that we've got revenue and and so I I think back to like Elon Musk and the early days of Tesla you know or Jeff

02:23:17	Bezos at at Amazon you know on any given day Elon musk could have you know Tesla could have come crashing down if if the lenders started saying you know enough is enough I'm not loaning you anymore it's time for you you know to either make money or or shut down and you know he he was able to to to navigate that as was Jeff when he was building Amazon but the typical small entrepreneur isn't going to get that kind of treatment you know they are not going to be able to sustain Innovation and investment in in

02:23:49	a hope in a prayer if they cannot prove that money is there so don't forget that while we may be interested in technologically changing the world there's the commercial aspect of we got to make money and before I worry about making money big I need to prove to people I can make money small and once I've got my product kind of to a stage to where it's re ready to revenue I need to turn down innovation turn up marketing and really focus on driving Revenue creation and customer adoption so that I can then start generating cash

02:24:22	which will let me then go back to innovating you know at a future time so we we have to be balanced a lot of times entrepreneurs forget the commercial aspect and the commercial aspect is we got to make money we're so busy innovating we forget that we have to make money before long it's like investors get tired of us because there's a thousand other things for them to invest in they pull the rug out from under us and we crash and burn and so the best technology on the planet does not guarantee you Commercial Success you

02:24:50	know we have to Drive commercial success as soon as we're able in order to prove the sustainability of our business no 100% And I I feel like ego has some kind of role in that where like an entrepreneur is like very convinced because of certain reasons but also their ego on why this Innovation will only cause growth although in reality it's only U hinders their growth like what do how would you that's why that that's why dreamers dream and doers do you know so there there's I call it the accidental

02:25:28	arrogance of success it's like PE people get so into their own you know self promotion that that you know I I'm God's gift and what I've done is going to change the world and you know I I see those pitches every day from people who are out there Adam my idea plus your wallet equals you know the best thing the planet has ever seen and I'm like first of all if you're talking to me about money you don't understand my value because my value is what's up here not what's in my wallet money is a commodity there's trillions of it out

02:26:00	there looking for Investments right now you know and so all you have to do is know where it is go go go go get it treat it well give it an outsized return and you'll get funded you know and so money is a commodity money's not the issue people who are focused on money is my problem don't understand how money works and so in addition to being you know call it a tech genius they need to have a business Acumen you know Andor partner with someone who understands business and and they can be the the the

02:26:30	strange person who's locked in the the dark room for 20 hours a day innovating and creating something great but they still need some business guy out there to be the front end and so when we get arrogant you know and and and keep in mind most of these people have not created anything yet you know and so if they have an arrogance of success and they have it before they're actually revenu and and building something special then boy that's that's a an entrepreneur who's going to have a hard time finding capital and finding money

02:27:02	there's a fine line between arrogance you know and confidence and we need to be confident we shouldn't be arrogant and if we're Arrogant with no money and we're Arrogant with an idea but no Revenue you know then investors just simply walk away you know I I that's not a not an ADV meure that I'm going to back so we we have to be careful about letting the arrogance of our genius Cloud our thinking and and ultimately investors see right through that and uh if there's you know what it's it's okay to be arrogant you know if you're the

02:27:39	richest man on the planet and you have you know you you have arrived when you have an idea and no revenue and you're arrogant and you're arrogant with investors that's not a good recipe for success and we are almost uh hitting the time and could um tell us about your services for example we have a new startups but they have no idea how to do business they don't have the business argument so maybe they can talk to you or yeah so I do Consulting work um you know people can read my books they're cheap you know
